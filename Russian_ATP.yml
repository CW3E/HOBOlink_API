## NetCDF Conversion Config File
# This is a configuration file for converting a station's csv files to netCDF format. It contains metadata about the station and also the metadata that the program needs to read and process the csv files.
# Use caution when editing this file. Changing certain features of this file (e.g. key names, variable names, indenting) will cause the code execution to fail. If you aren't sure what to edit, ask Jacob first.
